### Overview

Designo is a multi-page website created using React.js, React-router and plain CSS

### Html

I always use semantic and valid HTML5

### Css naming conventions

I used structural naming convention which means that you name elements by describing what they are, and not where they are or how they look.

### Responsive Design

In this project, I used media queries and percentages to achieve fluid responsive design.

### JavaScript

When I write JavaScript code, I always use the following design principles.
01. DRY, Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself
02. KISS, Keep It simple Stupid
03. Single Responsibility Principle
04. Separation of concerns

### React

In this project, I implemented the High Order Component Pattern, and I created a custom Hook to remove repetitive logic from components. Doing so, my components are more clear, readable, and maintainable. It also helps to avoid the long file/component syndrome.
