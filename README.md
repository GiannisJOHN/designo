### Overview

Designo is a multi-page website created using React.js, React-router and plain CSS

### Html

I always use semantic and valid HTML5

### Css naming conventions

I used structural naming convention which means that you name elements by describing what they are, and not where they are or how they look. This helps to write reusable styling that can work on different projects.

### Responsive Design

In this project, I used media queries and percentages to achieve a fluid responsive design.

### JavaScript

When I write JavaScript code, I always use the following design principles.
01. DRY, Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself
02. KISS, Keep It Simple Stupid 
03. Single Responsibility Principle
04. Separation of concerns

### React

In this project, I implemented the High Order Component Pattern, and I created a custom Hook to remove repetitive logic from components. By doing that, my components are clear, readable, and maintainable.
